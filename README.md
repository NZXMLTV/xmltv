# NZ XMLTV
This is a custom XMLTV designed for New Zealand (specifically Freeview TV). 

## Features:
- Automatically matches posters to shows, with posters being sourced from TheTVDB, IMDB, TVNZ, ThreeNow, HGTV and Choice TV. I am planning to add SKY Go (and potentially Maori TV) as sources. If a match is not found, a placeholder image is used.
- Searches for season and episode numbers and uses XMLTV numbering for them if found. If a show does not have a season or episode number, it will default to using the first date the script saw it (the script has been running since May)
- Adds ratings, actors and directors to movies
- Goes ahead 7 days
- Has all Freeview certified channels, plus Prime PLUS 1.

There are two guide versions that are developed together:
* [Original Guide](https://nzxmltv.github.io/xmltv/guide.xml). This is the original guide that still contains All New: and New: items on their titles.
* [Guide without 'new'](https://nzxmltv.github.io/xmltv/guide-v2.xml). A much requested feature is the removal of All New: and New: items on show titles. This guide adds this, but without breaking those that are still on the original guide.

Both of these will be updated together, so new features and bug fixes will affect both guides.
